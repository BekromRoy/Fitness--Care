        <p class="bek-muted">Leafy greens include kale, spinach, collards, swiss chards and a few others. They have several properties that make them perfect for a weight loss diet, such as being low in calories and carbohydrates and loaded with fiber. Eating leafy greens is a great way to increase the volume of your meals, without increasing the calories. Leafy greens are also incredibly nutritious and very high in many vitamins, antioxidants and minerals, including calcium, which has been shown to aid fat burning.</p>

        <p class="bek-muted">Tuna is another low-calorie, high-protein food. It’s lean fish, meaning it’s low in fat. Tuna is popular among bodybuilders and fitness models who’re on a cut, as it’s a great way to increase protein intake while keeping total calories and fat low. If you’re trying to emphasize protein intake, make sure to choose tuna canned in water, not oil.</p>

        <p class="bek-muted">One fruit that deserves to be highlighted is grapefruit. Its effects on weight control have been studied directly. In a 12-week study in 91 obese individuals, eating half a fresh grapefruit before meals led to weight loss of 3.5 pounds (1.6 kg). The grapefruit group also had reduced insulin resistance, a metabolic abnormality that is implicated in various chronic diseases. Therefore, eating half a grapefruit about half an hour before some of your daily meals may help you feel more satiated and eat fewer overall calories.</p>

        <h3>Home Made Protein Smoothies</h3>
        <hr class="dropdown-divider">
        <p class="bek-muted">Drinking homemade protein smoothies can be a highly nutritious and quick way to gain weight. It also gives you full control over the flavor and nutrient content. Here are just a few tasty variations you can try. You can combine each with 2 cups (470 mL) of dairy milk or soy milk if you have lactose intolerance. Both have more nutrients and calories than other alternative milks.</p>
        <p><span class="bek-muted-half">Chocolate banana nut shake : </span><span class="bek-muted">Combine 1 banana, 1 scoop of chocolate whey protein, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of peanut or another nut butter.</span></p>

        <h3>Milk</h3>
        <hr class="dropdown-divider">
        <p class="bek-muted">Milk has been used as a weight gainer or muscle builder for decades. It provides a good balance of proteins, carbs, and fats and is a good source of calcium, as well as other vitamins and minerals. For those trying to add more muscle, milk is an excellent protein source that provides both casein and whey proteins. <br>Try drinking one or two glasses of whole milk (149 calories per cup) as a snack, with a meal, or before and after a workout if you’re training.</p>

        <h3>Rice</h3>
        <hr class="dropdown-divider">
        <p class="bek-muted">Rice is a convenient, low cost carb source to help you gain weight. Just 1 cup (158 grams) of cooked white rice provides 204 calories, 44 grams of carbs, and very little fat. Rice is also fairly calorie-dense, meaning you can easily obtain a high amount of carbs and calories from a single serving. This helps you eat more food, especially if you have a poor appetite or get full quickly.</p>

        <h3>Nuts and Nut-Butter</h3>
        <hr class="dropdown-divider">
        <p class="bek-muted">Nuts and nut butters are perfect choices if you’re looking to gain weight. Just one small handful of raw almonds (1/4 cup) contains 170 calories, 6 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber, and 15 grams of healthy fats. Since nuts are very calorie-dense, just two handfuls per day with a meal or as a snack can quickly add hundreds of calories. You can add nut butters to a variety of snacks or dishes, such as smoothies, yogurts, and crackers, to turn them into a high calorie snack in no time.</p>

        <h3>Protein Supplements</h3>
        <hr class="dropdown-divider">
        <p class="bek-muted">Taking protein supplements is a common strategy for athletes and bodybuilders who want to gain weight. There are many types available, including whey, soy, egg, and pea protein. Whey protein supplements and mass gainers (supplements that can help you gain muscle mass) can be very easy and cost-effective strategies to gain weight, especially when combined with strength training. Some people think whey protein is unhealthy or unnatural, but this isn’t the case. Whey protein is made from dairy and has been shown to help improve health markers and reduce the risk of disease</p>

        <img src="images/dried fruits.jpg">
        <h3>Dried Fruits</h3>
        <hr class="dropdown-divider">
        <p class="bek-muted">Dried fruit is a high calorie snack that also provides antioxidants and micronutrients. You can get many different types of dried fruit, and they all have a naturally high sugar content. This makes them great for gaining weight, especially since they’re convenient to eat and taste great. While many people think fruits lose most of their nutrients when dried, this isn’t the case. Dried fruits contain lots of fiber and most of their vitamins and minerals remain intact. Try combining some dried fruit with a protein source, such as cuts of meat, cheese, or a whey protein shake. They also mix well with nuts and full fat plain Greek yogurt, providing a blend of healthy fats, protein, and other key nutrients.</p>
